name: experiment
description: Run a structured multi-variable investigation as a grid instead of one change at a time, and report results as a table.
---

# Trigger

Use when a task requires empirical comparison across multiple variables,
configurations, or parameters, rather than a single well-defined change.

Examples: performance tuning, hyperparameter sweeps, comparing
implementations, isolating which of several factors causes a result.

Do not use for a single targeted change with a known correct outcome —
use `work` directly.

# Inputs

Read:
- `AGENTS.md`;
- `PROJECT.md`;
- active phase in `plan.md`, if the experiment is part of approved work;
- relevant `issues.md`;
- relevant `docs/`;
- relevant source files.

# Preconditions

- The question being investigated is stated explicitly.
- The variables that plausibly affect the outcome are identifiable.

# Procedure

Use this order without reordering:

Research
→ Analysis
→ Experiment Grid
→ Run and Record
→ Result Analysis
→ Report

## Research

State what is already known or assumed about the variables and the
mechanism under test.

## Analysis

List the variables that plausibly affect the outcome.

For each variable, state the levels or values to test.

Identify variables to hold fixed and record their fixed value. Check
each fixed value against the current top-level goal (see `AGENTS.md` →
Constraint Provenance) rather than copying it from a prior plan,
experiment, or instruction — a fixed value that quietly excludes
something the goal requires testing is a correctness bug, not a
convenience.

## Experiment Grid

Enumerate every cell to run before running any of them.

A cell changes only the variables under test; fixed variables stay
constant across all cells.

Do not run cells opportunistically. Define the grid first.

## Run and Record

Run every cell in the grid.

Record for each cell:
- the exact configuration;
- the command;
- the raw measured result;
- the environment.

Do not discard a cell's result because it looks wrong. Record it and flag
it.

## Result Analysis

Compare cells. Do not attribute a result to a variable that changed
together with another variable.

State which variables the evidence supports and which it does not.

## Report

Report all cells as one table, not as a narration of individual runs.

Table columns: variables under test, fixed variables (if not constant
across the whole grid), and the measured result.

State the conclusion and its confidence separately from the table.

# Stop Conditions

Stop when:
- the grid cannot be run under fixed conditions (for example, a shared or
  noisy environment invalidates comparison);
- a required measurement is unavailable.

If the grid is impractically large, reduce it explicitly and record why,
rather than reverting to one-at-a-time changes.

# Completion

An experiment ends with:
- the full grid and its results as one table;
- a stated conclusion and its confidence;
- verified conclusions moved to `docs/`;
- unresolved findings moved to `issues.md`;
- unexplored grid cells moved to `opportunities.md`, if relevant.
